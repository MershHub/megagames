        <p>Fancy Pants Adventure is the original title of this awesome 2D platform series. It's one of the many Flash games you can now play in your web browser without the need for Flash.

In this game you take control of Fancy Pants - a cool stickman character who wears awesome and colorful pants! You must help our fancy hero work his way through a myriad of cool levels and avoid various obstacles, monsters and creatures on his way!

Fancy Pants can run and jump and you must control his movement using the keyboard arrow keys and jump using the S key. The different levels flow fantastically together and the gameplay is fun and reminiscent of retro platform titles such as sonic. Be sure to collect the squiggles as you progress and look out for spring boards and secret doors. Also look out for doors that take you to cool bonus levels. Can you complete every level and complete your first fancy adventure?</p>
